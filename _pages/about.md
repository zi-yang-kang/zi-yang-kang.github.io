<br>
I am a fifth-year graduate student at the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/ziyang-kang" style="text-decoration:none">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>.  I will join the <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">Center of Mathematical Sciences at Harvard University</a> as a Postdoctoral Fellow later this year.

In July 2024, I will join the <a href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php" style="text-decoration:none">Department of Economics at the University of Toronto</a> as an Assistant Professor.

I work on market design, mechanism design, and industrial organization.  My research applies a theoretical lens to policy design and evaluation.  

I have a two-word first name, "Zi Yang"; my last name is "Kang."
