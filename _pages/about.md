# About me
---

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University</a>.

I will join the <a href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php" style="text-decoration:none">Department of Economics at the University of Toronto</a> as an Assistant Professor in July 2024.

I work on market design, mechanism design, and industrial organization.  My research applies a theoretical lens to policy design and evaluation.

I have a two-word first name, "Zi Yang"; my last name is "Kang."
