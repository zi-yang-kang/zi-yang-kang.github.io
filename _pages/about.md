I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the <a href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php" style="text-decoration:none">University of Toronto</a>

I work on mechanism design, market design, and industrial organization.  My research applies a theoretical lens to policy design and evaluation.  

I am particularly interested in "partial mechanism design," where a policymaker can design only part of the market.  I taught a tutorial with <a href="https://ellenmuir.net" style="text-decoration:none">Ellen Muir</a> on this at <a href="https://ec23.sigecom.org/" style="text-decoration:none">EC'23</a>; check it out <a href="ec'23-tutorial" style="text-decoration:none">here</a>!

I have a two-word first name, "Zi Yang"; my last name is "Kang."  

You can download my CV <a href="/files/CV.pdf" style="text-decoration:none">here</a>.
