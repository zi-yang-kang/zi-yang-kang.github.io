<br>
I am a fifth-year graduate student at the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/ziyang-kang" style="text-decoration:none">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>.  

In summer 2023, I will join the <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/" style="text-decoration:none">Center of Mathematical Sciences at Harvard University</a> as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

I work on market design, mechanism design, and industrial organization.  My research applies a theoretical lens to problems in policy design and evaluation.

I have a two-word first name, "Zi Yang"; my last name is "Kang."
