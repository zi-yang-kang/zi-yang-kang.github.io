Contracts often impact market participants beyond the contracting parties---and hence indirectly affect the payoffs of the contracting parties.  Such equilibrium effects can substantially change the optimal structure of contracts and regulatory policies.
{: style="text-align: justify;"} 

In this tutorial, we show how tools developed for mechanism design can be adapted to study these equilibrium effects and derive optimal contracts. We present a unified framework of recent advances, with applications ranging from resale and vertical contracting by dominant firms to redistributive policies in private markets.

## Target Audience

This tutorial is targeted at researchers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduate students in economics and/or computer science.

## Prerequisites

We will assume basic familiarity with mechanism design.

## Structure

This tutorial consists of two 45-minute sessions:

1. **Part I** (<a href="https://ellenmuir.net" style="text-decoration:none">Ellen</a>)
   - Introduction and motivation
   - General framework to study equilibrium effects of contracts
   - Application #1: profit maximization with resale
